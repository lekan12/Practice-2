Even better, Arsenal lost at home against Watford, so Chelsea actually gained ground on the team that started the night in second place. Factor in Tottenham's two points dropped at Sunderland and this was a tidy night's work, Costa's false step notwithstanding. \r\nTrue, Liverpool looked the better side, but no points are awarded for endeavour or artistic impression. Chelsea did what they needed to do, keeping Liverpool at a significant arm's length. Maybe an arm and a half. Ten points is a lot with just 15 games to go. \r\n\r\n\r\n", "link"=>"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4177190/Liverpool-1-1-Chelsea-Wijnaldum-cancels-Luiz-s-opener.html", "writer"=>"Martin Samuel"}, "commit"=>"Update Review", "id"=>"7"}
